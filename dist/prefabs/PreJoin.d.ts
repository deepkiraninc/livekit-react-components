/**
 * The PreJoin prefab component is normally presented to the user before he enters a room.
 * This component allows the user to check and select the preferred media device (camera und microphone).
 * On submit the user decisions are returned, which can then be passed on to the LiveKitRoom so that the user enters the room with the correct media devices.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This component is independent from the LiveKitRoom component and don't has to be nested inside it.
 * Because it only access the local media tracks this component is self contained and works without connection to the LiveKit server.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * <PreJoin />
 * ```
